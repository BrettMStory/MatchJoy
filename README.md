# MatchJoy
A matching game using mathematical intersections and lack thereof to determine a match.

## Rules
A match is three tiles that satisfy the following conditions:

1. All the same number or all different numbers.

2. All the same color or all different colors.

3. All the same symbol or all different colors.

A match is worth 3 points, whereas an incorrect match will take away 1 point from your score. Earn as many points as possible in 60 seconds and beat your own best score.

## Build
This project can be built in Unity 5 and up. The two builds I have confirmed to work are the Android, Windows, and Web Player builds. I tried the WebGL build, but it seems like coroutines are completely busted on that one. Hopefully that gets fixed, since the Web Player recently lost support from Chrome. Feel free to let me know if you have problems on any other devices, or let me know if it works on a platform I haven't tested yet!
